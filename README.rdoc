= Tasteful Routes

{<img src="https://secure.travis-ci.org/icelab/tasteful-routes.png" />}[http://travis-ci.org/icelab/tasteful-routes]

An opinionated variation of the standard Rails RESTful routes that has singular member action URLs.

== Installation 

In your Gemfile:

  gem "tasteful_routes"

== Usage

Simply define your routes with tasteful_resources as you normally would with the {resources method}[http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Routing/Mapper/Resources.html#method-i-resources]:

  YourApp::Application.routes.draw do
    tasteful_resources :jobs
  end

This results in the following routes:

      jobs GET    /jobs(.:format)         {:controller=>"jobs", :action=>"index"}
           POST   /jobs(.:format)         {:controller=>"jobs", :action=>"create"}
   new_job GET    /job/new(.:format)      {:controller=>"jobs", :action=>"new"}
  edit_job GET    /job/:id/edit(.:format) {:controller=>"jobs", :action=>"edit"}
       job GET    /job/:id(.:format)      {:controller=>"jobs", :action=>"show"}
           PUT    /job/:id(.:format)      {:controller=>"jobs", :action=>"update"}
           DELETE /job/:id(.:format)      {:controller=>"jobs", :action=>"destroy"}

It should work with all the same options as resources, including nesting:

  YourApp::Application.routes.draw do
    tasteful_resources :jobs do
      tasteful_resources :items
    end
  end

This time resulting in:

      job_items GET    /job/:job_id/items(.:format)         {:controller=>"items", :action=>"index"}
                POST   /job/:job_id/items(.:format)         {:controller=>"items", :action=>"create"}
   new_job_item GET    /job/:job_id/item/new(.:format)      {:controller=>"items", :action=>"new"}
  edit_job_item GET    /job/:job_id/item/:id/edit(.:format) {:controller=>"items", :action=>"edit"}
       job_item GET    /job/:job_id/item/:id(.:format)      {:controller=>"items", :action=>"show"}
                PUT    /job/:job_id/item/:id(.:format)      {:controller=>"items", :action=>"update"}
                DELETE /job/:job_id/item/:id(.:format)      {:controller=>"items", :action=>"destroy"}
           jobs GET    /jobs(.:format)                      {:controller=>"jobs", :action=>"index"}
                POST   /jobs(.:format)                      {:controller=>"jobs", :action=>"create"}
        new_job GET    /job/new(.:format)                   {:controller=>"jobs", :action=>"new"}
       edit_job GET    /job/:id/edit(.:format)              {:controller=>"jobs", :action=>"edit"}
            job GET    /job/:id(.:format)                   {:controller=>"jobs", :action=>"show"}
                PUT    /job/:id(.:format)                   {:controller=>"jobs", :action=>"update"}
                DELETE /job/:id(.:format)                   {:controller=>"jobs", :action=>"destroy"}
